# LBD_CWOW
Lewy Body Dementia Center With Out Walls (LBD CWOW) RNAseq processing and analysis.
Anterior cingulate cortex tissue samples from the Mayo Clinic brain bank were collected for 619 individuals. 
Raw fastq files are available on SRA, PRJNA1023207.

| Disease                   | Count   |
| ------------------------- |:-------:|
| Control                   | 86      |
| Pathological  aging (PA)  | 39      |
| Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  | 54      |
| Lewy body dementia (LBD)  | 440     |

This git repo contains scripts for the following:
-   Metadata analysis of the 619 individuals. 
-   Processing of bulk-tissue RNA-sequencing data.
-   Gene-level differential expression among pairwise groups and within each genetic sex.
-   Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).  
-   Generation of manuscript figures from Olney et al. 202x publication 
-   Generation of shiny app for exploration of the results presented in Olney et al. 202x publication, view app [here](https://fryerlab.shinyapps.io/LBD_CWOW/)


## Create conda environment
The necessary software for bulk RNAseq data processing is contained in: `LBD.yml`.

To create the environment:
```
conda env create -n LBD --file LBD.yml

# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate LBD
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate

```
After the conda LBD environment has been created, you will need to additionally install GATK.
This step must be done manually and not through conda; see [here](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036194592-Getting-started-with-GATK4). The link will explain how to download GATK4, then you will need to add an alias to your bash profile. 
```
alias gatk='/path/to/gatk-package/gatk'
```
## Download fastq files and human reference genome 
### Download the raw fastq files from the SRA PRJNA1023207
The raw fast files may be obtained from SRA PRJNA1023207. There are 619 individuals. Samples were sequenced to ~50 million (M) 2 × 100 bp paired-end reads across two lanes. Total storage requirements for the raw gzip sequences exceeded 3TB. Information on how to download from SRA may be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sradownload/). 

Download or move the raw sequences to the raw_fastq folder. 

### Download the human GRCh38 reference genome and create sex chromosome complement reference genomes. 

## Run Snakemake for bulk RNAseq  data processing 
1. get_read_group_info.sh script will list the fastq files that are located in the raw_fastq folder and collect header information that will be used to create the config file in the next step. 
```
sh scripts/snakemake/get_read_group_info.sh
```

2. create_RNA_config.py will create a config file of the sample IDs that are outputted from running the step above. 
```
python create_RNA_config.py
```

3. Run Snakemake which will merge samples that were sequenced on multiple lanes, generate fastqc reports, align to the reference genome, and collect RNA metrics. It is highly recommended to run snakemake in script on an HPC cluster.
```
snakemake -s RNA.alignment.Snakefile -j 100 --rerun-incomplete 
```
The above command will submit 100 jobs in parallel and re-run any incomplete jobs.
